<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Roosevelt Alejandro</h1>
<h3 align="center">A student of Software Engineering</h3>

- I really like to keep an eye on new technologies and find ways to implement them in my daily use. I am interested in backend development, currently, in a self-taught way, I am learning JAVA and its technologies (Java, Java EE, Hibernate and Spring (Spring Boot), Web Services, PrimeFaces).

- Also, in a self-taught way I am learning to use python in a deeper way, using technologies such as: Tkinter, Pyside, Django, Flask, SQL, among others.

- However, I am not only interested in learning backend development, I am also interested in frontend development. I am currently learning technologies in this field such as: HTML, CSS, SASS, Workflows, JavaScript, Fetch, PHP, among others.
