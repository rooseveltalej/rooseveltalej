<h1 align="left">Hi, I'm Roosevelt Alejandro</h1>


<h3 align="left">Computer engineering undergraduate</h3>


I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at the Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Costa Rica. I began my studies in the field of computer science in June 2022, and since then, it's been a continuous journey of learning.

Thanks to my academic background, I have built a solid foundation of knowledge. However, I always seek learning opportunities beyond the classroom. I am passionate about complementing my formal education with self-directed studies, using online resources such as Udemy and YouTube to delve into various topics.

Through these platforms, I have expanded my repertoire of technological tools, acquiring and refining skills in programming languages such as Java, Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript, as well as full-stack web development technologies, including Node.js for server-side applications, and HTML and CSS for client-side structure and design. This hybrid learning approach has allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical projects, thereby enhancing my understanding and technical skills.
