# Hi, I'm Roosevelt Alejandro

### Computer Engineering Student


I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering at the Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica (since June 2022).

I am passionate about Linux and develop software on Fedora 41 with KDE Plasma.

#### Contributions

Although I haven’t formally contributed to open-source projects, I make a point of keeping my projects in public repositories to share my work and potentially help others who may find it useful.

#### Areas of Interest

I am particularly drawn to web application development due to its flexibility and the potential to create impressive solutions quickly. I also enjoy working on backend development. Additionally, I have an interest in cloud computing and data science, though I have yet to delve deep into these fields.
